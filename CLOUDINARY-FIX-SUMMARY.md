## 🔍 Debugging Console Messages

Open browser developer tools (F12) and look for:

```
=== Aadya Admin Panel Diagnostics ===
1. Cloudinary available: true
2. Firebase available: true  
3. Config loaded: {cloudName: "djrtuevfb", uploadPreset: "aadya-dresses", folder: "aadya-products"}
```

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

### Check Your Upload Preset
Your Cloudinary preset should have these **exact** settings:

```
Upload preset name: aadya-dresses
Signing mode: Unsigned
Asset folder: aadya-products
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Error Message | Solution |
|---------------|----------|
| `preset not found` | Verify preset name is exactly `aadya-dresses` |
| `Cloudinary widget not loaded` | Check internet connection |
| `cloud name invalid` | Verify cloud name is `djrtuevfb` |
| `CORS error` | Enable CORS in Cloudinary settings |

### Alternative Test Method
1. Open [`cloudinary-test.html`](cloudinary-test.html) for comprehensive testing
2. Use the diagnostic tools to identify specific issues

## 📋 Your Current Configuration

```javascript
// Cloudinary Config (Updated)
const CLOUDINARY_CONFIG = {
    cloudName: 'djrtuevfb',           // ✅ Your cloud name
    uploadPreset: 'aadya-dresses',   // ✅ Your actual preset
    folder: 'aadya-products'         // ✅ Target folder
};
```

## 🎯 Expected Flow After Fix

2. **Select images** → Upload progress shows
3. **Upload completes** → Image appears in preview
4. **Fill product form** → Add product details
5. **Submit form** → Product saves with images to Firebase
6. **Check homepage** → Product appears with uploaded images

## ✅ Final Status

- ✅ Firebase configuration: Complete

- ✅ Upload widget: Enhanced with diagnostics
